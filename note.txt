(1) variable -> is a container to hold data
(2) data type -> defines the type of data a VARIABLE can hold
(3) by default C++ takes decimal values as double not float...
(4) typcasting means to convert one data type to another data type
(5) constant are used when we wish that the values of certain things does not change.
        i.e const int a = 3.14; --if we try to change the value of a we will get an error
(6) manipulator are those operators which are used to formatt the data
(7) precedence means that which arithematic operator will be executed first
(8) associativity means that which arithematic operator will be executed first and if the oprator is same then it associativity is checked
(9) sizeof() is a operator which is used to find the size of a variable
(10) control structure in c++
        i) selection structure
        ii) sequence structure
        iii) loop structure

                a) if
                b) if else
                c) nested if
                d) switch
                a) for
                b) while
                c) do while
                a) break
                b) continue
                c) goto

(11) array is a collection of similar data types int, float, char, double etc
(12) loop are used to execute a block of code multiple times
(13) pointer is a data type which holds the address of another variable
(14) function is a block of code which is used to perform a specific task
(15) pointer arithematic formula:
        new_address = current_address + (i * sizeof(data_type))
(16) structure is a user-defined data types which is used to different type of data-type
(17) char can store only one character.
(18) unions are used to store different data types in a single variable.they are like structure but provide better memory management
(19) enum is a user-defined data type which is used to store a list of constants
(20) typedef is a keyword which is used to give a new name to an existing data type
(21) file handling is a process of storing data in a file and retrieving data from a file
(22) class is a user-defined data type which is used to store different data types
(23) object is a instance of a class
(24) function prototyping is a process of declaring a function before its definition
(25) A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
(26) actual parameters are the values passed to the function
(27) formal parameters are the parameters of the function
(28) call by reference is a method of passing arguments to a function in which the address of the arguments is passed to the function
(29) call by value is a method of passing arguments to a function in which the value of the arguments is passed to the function
(30) static variable is a variable which is declared inside a function and it's value is retained even after the function has returned a value 
(31) inline function is a function which is declared as inline and it's definition is inserted at the point of call
        -->we should not use inline function when:
                1) If a function contains a loop. (for, while, do-while)
                2) If a function contains static variables.
                3) If a function is recursive.
                4) If a function return type is other than void, and the return statement doesnâ€™t exist in function body.
                5) If a function contains switch or goto statement.
(32) default argument is a argument which is passed to a function if no argument is passed to the function
(33) constant variable --> When you do not want others (or yourself) to change existing variable values, use the const keyword
(34) Recursion --> Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.
