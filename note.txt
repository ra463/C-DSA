(1) variable -> is a container to hold data
(2) data type -> defines the type of data a VARIABLE can hold
(3) by default C++ takes decimal values as double not float...
(4) typcasting means to convert one data type to another data type
(5) constant are used when we wish that the values of certain things does not change.
        i.e const int a = 3.14; --if we try to change the value of a we will get an error
(6) manipulator are those operators which are used to formatt the data
(7) precedence means that which arithematic operator will be executed first
(8) associativity means that which arithematic operator will be executed first and if the oprator is same then it associativity is checked
(9) sizeof() is a operator which is used to find the size of a variable
(10) control structure in c++
        i) selection structure
        ii) sequence structure
        iii) loop structure

                a) if
                b) if else
                c) nested if
                d) switch
                a) for
                b) while
                c) do while
                a) break
                b) continue
                c) goto

(11) array is a collection of similar data types int, float, char, double etc
(12) loop are used to execute a block of code multiple times
(13) pointer is a data type which holds the address of another variable
(14) function is a block of code which is used to perform a specific task
(15) pointer arithematic formula:
        new_address = current_address + (i * sizeof(data_type))
(16) structure is a user-defined data types which is used to different type of data-type
(17) char can store only one character.
(18) unions are used to store different data types in a single variable.they are like structure but provide better memory management
(19) enum is a user-defined data type which is used to store a list of constants
(20) typedef is a keyword which is used to give a new name to an existing data type
(21) file handling is a process of storing data in a file and retrieving data from a file
(22) class is a user-defined data type which is used to store different data types
(23) object is a instance of a class
