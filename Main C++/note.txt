(1) variable -> is a container to hold data
(2) data type -> defines the type of data a VARIABLE can hold
(3) by default C++ takes decimal values as double not float...
(4) typcasting means to convert one data type to another data type
(5) constant are used when we wish that the values of certain things does not change.
        i.e const int a = 3.14; --if we try to change the value of a we will get an error
(6) manipulator are those operators which are used to formatt the data
(7) precedence means that which arithematic operator will be executed first
(8) associativity means that which arithematic operator will be executed first and if the oprator is same then it associativity is checked
(9) sizeof() is a operator which is used to find the size of a variable
(10) control structure in c++
        i) selection structure
        ii) sequence structure
        iii) loop structure

                a) if
                b) if else
                c) nested if
                d) switch
                a) for
                b) while
                c) do while
                a) break
                b) continue
                c) goto

(11) array is a collection of similar data types int, float, char, double etc
(12) loop are used to execute a block of code multiple times
(13) pointer is a variable which holds the address of another variable
(14) function is a block of code which is used to perform a specific task
